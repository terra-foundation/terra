# 🌎 Terra

**Grow intelligent systems, not just apps.  
Orchestrate agents, prompts, and workflows — like building blocks — into living, evolving environments.**

---

## ✨ What is Terra?

Terra is an open, modular environment for **building and evolving AI agents**.  
It focuses on **ease of orchestration**, **daily growth**, and **developer sovereignty**.

- **Agents, flows, prompts** are modular, simple to create or remix.
- **Orchestration** is lightweight — just copy, configure, combine.
- **Daily reinforcement cycles** nudge systems to grow intelligently.
- **Full AIOS + Cerebrum integration** for seamless kernel-level memory, storage, and execution.

> **No black boxes. No bloated platforms. Terra lets you grow real, modular AI ecosystems — your way.**

---

## 🌱 Philosophy

- **Freedom** over lock-in
- **Creation** over consumption
- **Agency** over automation
- **Evolution** over stagnation

> **Terra is for those who want to shape their own intelligent worlds — not rent them.**

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/terra.git
cd terra
```

---

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
# with conda
conda create -n terra-env python=3.10
conda activate terra-env

# or with venv
python3 -m venv terra-env
source terra-env/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Terra will automatically install all required libraries — including Cerebrum.

---

### 4. Start the Kernel

Terra operates on an **AIOS Kernel** backend.

Launch it:

```bash
python -m runtime.launch
```

- Runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- No special setup needed if you just want to get started

✅ The system is now alive and ready.

---

## 🚀 First Actions Inside Terra

Once the kernel is running:

- Trigger daily agent missions (example):
  
  ```bash
  python sdk/agent_cycles/dogfeeder_cycle.py
  ```

- Explore and extend:
  - Add your own prompts
  - Build custom agents
  - Combine modular flows

Everything in Terra is designed to be **composable and remixable**.

## 📚 Requirements

Already handled in `requirements.txt`, including:

- **cerebrum** (`git+https://github.com/agiresearch/Cerebrum.git`)
- **litellm**, **pydantic**, **fastapi**, **uvicorn**
- **chromadb**, **redis**, **sentence-transformers**
- **nltk**, **scikit-learn**, **openai**, and others

If you ever need to regenerate:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs .
```

## 🔥 Why Terra Exists

Because orchestrating powerful AI environments should feel like **building with living blocks**, not fighting hidden rules.

Because **modularity**, **freedom**, and **daily growth** are not luxuries — they're essential.

Because **the future of AI belongs to builders, not platforms.**

---

## 🧠 Who is Terra For?

- Builders who want to *compose living systems, not static apps*.
- Creators who want *agents and flows they can actually own*.
- Developers who want *freedom to grow without permission*.
- Researchers and dreamers ready to *plant their own intelligent gardens*.

## ✨ Quick Philosophy Summary

> **Terra is your land.**  
> **Prompts are seeds.**  
> **Agents are the gardeners.**  
> **Flows are the rivers.**  
> **Memory is the soil.**  
>  
> 🛠️ Grow wisely. Build freely. Welcome home.
