# Terra Foundation

Terra Foundation is an independent AI lab building open-source tools to improve digital workflows and organizational intelligence.

We believe in small, focused systems that solve real bottlenecks â€” from job search automation to communication triage and beyond.

### ðŸš€ Projects
- [Job Explorer](https://github.com/terra-foundation/job-explorer): Score, rank, and triage job opportunities automatically.
- [Docs](https://terra-foundation.github.io/job-explorer-docs): Our product documentation and user guides.

We're just getting started. If you're curious, feel free to explore or contribute.
